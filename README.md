# working-portfolio

Advanced CSS Challenge #2

This is a starting site to provide some background information on myself, along with a preview of some of the work I have done so far. 
I will add more to this portfolio as I progress throughout the rest of the class. The website is designed to be used regardless of device and screen size, 
and clicking the links in the nav bar should direct you to the corresponding section.
